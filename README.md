### Project Description:
This project investigates the factors that influence long-term book popularity using Goodreads data. The analysis focuses on early review activity, rating patterns, and genre information to understand how these signals relate to multi-year performance. By combining exploratory analysis with Random Forest modeling, the project identifies the strongest predictors of sustained readership and offers practical insights that can support authors and publishers in planning launches and long-term engagement strategies.
